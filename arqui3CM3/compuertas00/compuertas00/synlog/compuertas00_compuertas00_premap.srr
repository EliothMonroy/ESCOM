@W: MT531 :"c:\users\elith\documents\github\arqui3cm3\compuertas00\compuertas00.vhdl":26:2:26:5|Found signal identified as System clock which controls 8 sequential elements including Y[7:0].  Using this clock, which has no specified timing constraint, can prevent conversion of gated or generated clocks and can adversely impact design performance.
