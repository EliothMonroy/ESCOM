@W: MT531 :"c:\users\eliot\documents\github\arqui3cm3\word00\coder00.vhdl":16:2:16:5|Found signal identified as System clock which controls 4 sequential elements including W02.outcoder_1[6].  Using this clock, which has no specified timing constraint, can prevent conversion of gated or generated clocks and can adversely impact design performance.
