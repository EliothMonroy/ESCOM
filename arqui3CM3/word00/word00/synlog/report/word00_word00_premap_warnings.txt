@W: MO129 :"c:\users\eliot\documents\github\arqui3cm3\word00\coder00.vhdl":16:2:16:5|Sequential instance W02.outcoder_1[1] is reduced to a combinational gate by constant propagation.
@W: MT531 :"c:\users\eliot\documents\github\arqui3cm3\word00\coder00.vhdl":16:2:16:5|Found signal identified as System clock which controls 4 sequential elements including W02.outcoder_1[6].  Using this clock, which has no specified timing constraint, can prevent conversion of gated or generated clocks and can adversely impact design performance. 
@W: MT529 :"c:\users\eliot\documents\github\arqui3cm3\divosc00vhdl\div00.vhdl":21:2:21:3|Found inferred clock osc00|osc_int_inferred_clock which controls 23 sequential elements including W00.DO1.sdiv[21:0]. This clock has no specified timing constraint which may prevent conversion of gated or generated clocks and may adversely impact design performance.
