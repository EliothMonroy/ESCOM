@W: FX474 |User-specified initial value defined for some sequential elements which can prevent optimum synthesis results from being achieved. 
@W: MT531 :"c:\users\elith\documents\github\arqui3cm3\bcd01\mux04.vhdl":21:7:21:10|Found signal identified as System clock which controls 7 sequential elements including U15.outBCDmux_1[6:1].  Using this clock, which has no specified timing constraint, can prevent conversion of gated or generated clocks and can adversely impact design performance. 
@W: MT529 :"c:\users\elith\documents\github\arqui3cm3\bcd01\bcd00\source\div00.vhdl":21:2:21:3|Found inferred clock osc00|osc_int_inferred_clock which controls 23 sequential elements including U14.DO1.sdiv[21:0]. This clock has no specified timing constraint which may prevent conversion of gated or generated clocks and may adversely impact design performance.
